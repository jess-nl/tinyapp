## User Stories

As a writer and Twitter user, I would like to fit as many text as possible in a tweet. However, URLs are often very long. 

I have an idea!

Perhaps I can shorten my URLs and display them in the tweet through Tiny App! I can also collect them in case I need them in the near future.

This would allow my audience to visit the articles I publish. It would also allow them to share my articles around with the tiny URL I provided in my tweet.
